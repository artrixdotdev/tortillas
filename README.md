A terminal TUI torrent client.

## Roadmap

This serves as a very general and broad roadmap of what we intend to do with this library/CLI. If you see anything that you would like to contribute to, please see `CONTRIBUTING.md`! We're always happy to have a bit of help.

We plan to support:

- uTP peer connections
- TCP peer connections
- Webtorrent (WSS) peer connections

We currently support:

- Handling Magnet URIs
- Handling Torrent files

We are currently working on (this may be a little bit out of date, feel free to ):

- uTP peer connections
- TCP peer connections

## Testing

We use [Nextest](https://nexte.st/) for testing. You may have to install Nextest locally on your machine in order to run tests. You can see how to do so [here](https://nexte.st/docs/installation/pre-built-binaries/).
